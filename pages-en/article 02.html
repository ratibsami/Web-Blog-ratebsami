                The Pied Piper of Hamelin is a tragic tale set in the Middle Ages in the year 1284 AD in the small town of Hamelin in Germany. It is based on sources that have been recounted by various writers, including Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the Brothers Grimm, and Robert Browning. In this article, I have drawn from supplementary sources provided by the Brothers Grimm.
                According to the Brothers Grimm's account, one day the town of Hamelin was besieged by a horde of rats. The townsfolk were thrown into chaos. Eventually, they went to the mayor of Hamelin seeking help. The mayor, fearful of the people's unrest, convened his council to resolve the rat infestation. Meanwhile, the Pied Piper arrived in Hamelin with his enchanting flute. He went to the mayor and offered his solution: for a sum of coins, he would lure all the rats out of the town. The mayor agreed, and the next morning, the Pied Piper, by playing his magical flute that only rats could hear, led all the rats out of the town and into the Weser River.
                The town returned to its former state, and the people were relieved that the poisonous rats had disappeared. The Pied Piper went to the mayor to collect his fee for the service he had rendered to the city. However, the mayor refused to pay the Pied Piper, accusing him instead of being a charlatan who had orchestrated the events himself. The Pied Piper, feeling slighted, addressed the mayor, warning that he would do something that the people of Hamelin would never forget, and he left the town.
                The following Monday, as all the townspeople went to their places of worship, according to the custom, children were not allowed to participate in the adults' ceremonies. Therefore, the children were busy with their games in the town until the Pied Piper entered and began to play his flute. All the children, drawn by the Pied Piper's music, gathered around him, and, following him, they left the town in pursuit of the Pied Piper. They entered a cave in the mountain along with the Pied Piper and disappeared. Similar accounts, as mentioned in all the writers' works, have stated that the number of missing children was said to be 130.

                Later, when the people returned from their religious ceremonies to find their children gone, the town fell into utter chaos. They searched all over Hamelin, but only one child remained in the town, a crippled boy who recounted the story to the townsfolk. According to the tale, one of the abducted children was the daughter of the mayor of Hamelin.

                 <b>Critique of the Story </b> <br>
                 Different interpretations have been written by scholars, but based on three remaining pieces of evidence in Hamelin, which are:
                 <ul class="list">
                    <li>Handwritten notes left by a priest who lived in the 1270s.</li>
                    <li>Remaining writings in the town hall records of Hamelin in the Middle Ages.</li>
                    <li>A painting on the window of St. Nicholas' Church Market Kirche in Hamelin, depicting a closed-lip pied piper.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                My critique and analysis lead me to either believe or disbelieve this story. Nonetheless, in that year in Hamelin, 130 children lost their lives. Whether due to plague or the Pied Piper, an unresolved tragedy will remain.
